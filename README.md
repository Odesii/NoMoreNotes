# NoMoreNotes

_Skip this README at your own peril—it's like ignoring the warning label on a firework. Surprisingly common and mildly entertaining for the bystanders._

## Overview

Welcome to NoMoreNotes, a simple note-taking web app that you can download and use offline. Because apparently, jotting down thoughts in a physical notebook is too passé for the 21st century.

## Features

- **Infinite scroll:** Depends on your writing, not on some fancy algorithm. Keep writing until your fingers fall off.
- **Unique organization:** Ha! Just line numbers. If you were hoping for categories or tags, you clearly overestimated our ambition.

## Technical Details

### Tech Stack

For those who care about what's under the hood (_and for those who just nod and pretend they understand_), here’s what’s powering this monumental waste of bytes:

- ![JavaScrip](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=Javascript) - The cornerstone of web development.
- ![Node JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node%20JS-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm) - Because why not run JavaScript everywhere?
- ![Express JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express%20JS-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=express) - Minimal and flexible, unlike this app's feature set.
- ![WEB PACK](https://img.shields.io/badge/WEB%20PACK-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=Webpack) - Bundling all our hopes and dreams into one package.

## Contact

### Don't

Honestly, it's better for both of us if you don't try to contact me. If you're desperate, scream into the void; it's just as effective and significantly less annoying for me.

Enjoy NoMoreNotes, because life is too short for feature-rich, overly functional note-taking apps.
